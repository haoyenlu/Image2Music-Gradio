# Tiktok-Techjam Challenge - Image-to-Music GenAI
Generative AI is a super strong tool that can generate basically anything. In this project, I utilized existing Gen AI model (Llava and Musicgen) to develop a web application that allow user to get a custom music based on the image.
The UI of this project is built upon [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio.git), which is an open-source, light-weighted frontend library for quick and fast machine learning model demo.
The website is hosted using Vest.Ai GPU server. Try out the demo with this url: (Image2Music)[http://91.150.160.38:1632/]
